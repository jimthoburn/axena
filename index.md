## About

“HOSPITALITY” – the modern day term fo. “hospice”, a medieval word for a sanctuary of peace and safety for travelers on a pilgrimage. As in days of old. the modern “Hotel Manager” is responsible for the peace and safety of his guests, he must know his world like no other, he must be willing to put the safety and well being of his guests and staff as his utmost mission, without thought or consequence to his own.

Your search for a management company must be as diligent as the man you expect to manage your facility. There can be no doubt in your mind that you have enlisted the best. The best can be hard to find or even notice, unless you know the questions to ask or the attributes of character to look for. The hotel or restaurant manager’s qualifications are just as much about character as they are about technical knowledge. The management company’s mission is multifaceted on many levels and all should be known by you, should be enquired about by you and demanded by you.

They are:

The guest must be made to feel safe and welcome, pleased and happy in his new surroundings.

The staff must be made to feel safe in their surroundings as well, secure in their reliance on management that there is someone in authority at all times, someone who knows their (staff’s) job better than they do, someone approachable who has their interests at heart and can solve their job problems without hesitation.

The product must be the best it can be. Food must be always according to menu design and hot or cold, always ON TIME. Drinks must pleasing and quenching and ON TIME. Food or beverage should never be left on a plate or in the glass due to taste or quality. Rooms and facilities must be clean, hygienic and in the best repair possible. guests will tolerate normal wear and tear as long as the house is clean.

The financial well being of the property must be a primary concern, no less important than the first three and will fall into line if the preceding rules are met. the profitability of the facility is of obvious importance and must be maintained or the owners must know why. Knowledge of the financial situation of the facility must be second nature to your management company and its’ managers. Any failure in this regard can be catastrophic and should not be tolerated.

The common thread for all business, particularly in the United States and Europe, has always been the desire for profit, fulfilling the taste for power, the search for more in other words “greed”. That’s OK, it is this drive that has made America the most powerful nation on the planet but it is also this same drive that has segregated our people into “haves and have nots”, helped establish a class of people so poor that America can boast “the third world” within her borders. This need not be the case, there is certainly enough to go around if we are patient enough to let it happen naturally and in due course rather that the “get in and out as quick as you can” mentality, we can once again be the “greatest country in the world”.

We have been in the hospitality industry for many decades, we have studied and audited them, conducte. “proformas and performas”. budgets and projection. and we have opined on the investment side and the tax side. The numbers have all changed over the years with the ever changing politics of tax and profit but one axiom has always been constant and made itself known to us years ago.

Hospitality axiom: Always providing your best product and service equals customer attraction and loyalty which in turn equals long term profit and growth.

AXENA HOSPITALITY has long since known that profit for profit’s sake will eventually weaken a company to point of failure, it is inevitable. AXENA HOSPITALITY has been witness to many hotels and restaurants that have succumbed because, although the mission of each of these businesses may have started out with the good intentions of providing the best product for the best price, they would soon be transitioned when owners and managers tasted the possibilities of profit. These “good intentions” become a mission to make as much profit as possibl. so that when it fails (and it will) the owners can get out quickly and painlessly with as much as they can.

All is not doom, however, there is also a trend, albeit, slow moving, to reverse and change this philosophy of greed and inevitable failure to long term growth and ultimate success, to actually respect the customer enough to provide the best possible product and service for the most affordable price to the consumer. These hoteliers know that character of product and service will impress the consumer i. way. that will continually and repeatedly prompt return business without question. If the product can be trusted to be there when you return – you will return, case in point “MacDonalds”.

AXENA HOSPITALITY’s management strategy is to create or build the very best product possible, a tasteful, elegant room that is consistently warm and dry, safe and clean. An eating and drinking establishment that can be counted on to provide food just the way it’s supposed to be, on time and hot with drinks that will always warm the heart, be it a stunning margarita or a fabulous hot chocolate.

Creating a great product is only a part of the equation, CHARACTER, in the form of honesty and genuine caring for the customer’s comfort and pleasure are an integra. key to the success of your hotel or restaurant. AXENA HOSPITALITY wil. hire only staff that possess a genuine caring for the job and the customer. We will train them to be courteous and kind an. mean it, not to fake it. Not boy scouts, after all, we cater to discretion and the “after dark. side of business but individuals that genuinely care and respect others and themselves before profit. We will teach them that impressing customers with a caring attitude that puts the customer first before all others will be rewarded in many ways not only in customer returns an. tips but also in personal and professional growth.

The following is a common description that you will find in the brochures of most management companies.

“Hotel and restaurant managers improve the profitability of their businesses by ensuring quality control and a pleasant experience for their customers. They work with employees to provide a smoothly functioning system within the hotel or restaurant. Managers must have supervisory, administrative and marketing skills, and must have a thorough understanding of finance management to operate the business effectively.”

Management tip: Your product or service cannot always be the best but it must always be your best.

These are fine words and we could not have said it better but for us at AXENA HOSPITALITY they go without saying and they lack the one trait of character that is the real key to success, that is staff and management that actually care more about the customer and the product before themselves. AXENA HOSPITALITY is a management group that puts the hotel/restaurant and the owners above themselves, knowing that if you’re happy and financially satisfied then so will we be, it’s all in the attitude – like most things, good and bad, it also rolls downhill an. it’s contagious.

Manager’s role in Hospitality Industry: as a successful manager, you must exhibit many skills and command much specialized knowledge, all directed at achieving a variety of management objectives. There are 3 general kinds of hospitality objectives with which management must be concerned:

A manager wants to make the guest feel welcome. This requires both a friendly manner on your part toward the guest and an atmosphere of liberality and good will among the people who work with you in serving the guest. That always translates to an organization in which workers get along well with another.

Managers wants to make things work for the guest. Food has to be savory, hot or cold according to design, and on time. Beds must be made and rooms cleaned. A hospitality system requires a lot of work, and the manager must see that it is done.

A manager wants to make sure that operation will continue to provid. the best possible services and produc. while also making a profit.

It is for these reasons that your choice for your Hospitality Management MUST be Axena Hospitality. we pledge maximum effort, superior skills and excellence in attitude.
